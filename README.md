# PythonOptimization
This repository is created to share some basic Python implementations of the solution for the combinatorial optimization problems. Unless stated otherwise, GUROBI api is used as solver. These pieces of codes might be helpful for practicing the basics of implementation of optimization algorithms and techniques for your project, homework, etc.
